        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Jenniffer Del Real and I am 18 years old. I grew up in a city called Paramount, CA. I am a friendly, dependable, and organized person. I am also very responsible and motivated to do my best at anything I have to do.In my free time I enjoy learning new languages. I am fluent in both English as well as Spanish. I am able to comfortably translate between English and Spanish. I know a bit of French and also a bit of Korean. I also enjoy traveling and hanging out with my friends. Some of the places I have traveled to include Mexico, Korea, and Japan. In the future I hope to travel to Paris and Italy. In addition, I also enjoy volunteering in community service programs in my hometown. I also like drawing in my free time.  I enjoy meeting new people and learning about different cultures. Some of my interests include Psychology, Biology, and Business.  <br><br>

        I am a first generation college student. I am currently attending University of California, Riverside and I am a first year. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. My expected graduation year is 2023. I am interested in a career as a Child Psychologist. I have had a great experience at UCR so far. At first it was a bit difficult to the fast pace of the quarter system, but after a while it became easier. I hope that my time in college helps me grow as a person. Being at UCR has helped me strengthen my organization skills and has enabled me to meet new people with different backgrounds. My strongest inspiration is my family. I hope to be able to provide them with any help they need. I also hope to set a good example for all my younger siblings.<br><br>

        I attended Paramount High School and graduated in 2019. During high school I was a member and team leader of Green Club. Green Club is a club that brings awareness to environmental issues. My job as a green club member and leader was to spread awareness of environmental issues that affected our community. I also helped recruit other members. I would also help recycle weekly. As a green club member another one of my responsibilities was to help clean up the school. We also provided our community with ways in which we could be more eco friendly. I also volunteered in monthly city clean ups as well as various beach clean ups. In addition to being a Green Club Member I also frequently volunteered in as many events as possible in my community. Some of my volunteer experiences included helping in school related events, helping organize city events, and tutoring foreign exchange students at my high school.After graduating high school, I worked a job full time. Coming from a low income family, I had to work and save up during summer in order to afford my attendence at UCR. In addition to working, I also helped my mom take care of my younger siblings.
